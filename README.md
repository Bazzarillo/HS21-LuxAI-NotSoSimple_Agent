# HS21-LuxAI-NotSoSimple_Agent

Repo for the final project in the main seminar "Introduction to Computer Science" in HS21 at the University of Lucerne.

As a final project, the authors will participate in the public Kaggle Challenge *"Lux AI "*. More information can be found here: [Lux AI](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021)

## The challenge

*The Lux AI Challenge is a competition where competitors design agents to tackle a multi-variable optimization, resource gathering, and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against other competitors. In addition to optimization, successful agents must be capable of analyzing their opponents and developing appropriate policies to get the upper hand.*

Most of the work that goes into this project revolves around the "agent.py"-File, where we build up our automated agent. The active agent stays in the root folder, legacy code or alternated versions may be found in here.
